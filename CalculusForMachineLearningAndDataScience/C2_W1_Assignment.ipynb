    "In this assignment you will solve a simple optimization problem for a function of one variable. Given a dataset of historical prices of a product from two suppliers, your task is to identify what share of the product you should buy from each of the suppliers to make the best possible investment in the future. Stating the problem mathematically, you will construct a target function to minimize, evaluate its minimum and investigate how its derivative is connected with the result."

During the production process, an essential product P is used, which can be supplied from one of two partners - supplier A and supplier B.

Choosing the supplier, you noticed, that there were some periods in the past, when it would be more profitable to use supplier A (the prices of product P were lower), and other periods to work with supplier B. For the Budget model you can set some percentage of the goods to be purchased from supplier A (e.g. 60%) and the remaining part from supplier B (e.g. 40%), but this split should be kept consistent for the whole of the twelve months period. The Budget will be used in preparation for the contract negotiations with both suppliers.\n",

This is a very simple example of a model with one parameter, resulting in optimization of a function of one variable.

But in machine learning the models have hundreds of parameters, using similar approach you would need to perform millions of target function evaluations.
