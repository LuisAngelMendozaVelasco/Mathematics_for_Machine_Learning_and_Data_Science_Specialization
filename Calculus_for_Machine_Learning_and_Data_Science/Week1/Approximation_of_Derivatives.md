# Approximation of Derivatives

This is an ungraded tool to develop your understanding of the material. 

Here you can compare how much the approximation of derivative $\Delta f/\Delta x$  differs from the exact derivative $df/dx$, depending on the size of $\Delta x$. Dragging the black dot on the top graph you can change the value of $\Delta x$ - to control the length of the interval on which the approximation is calculated. Dragging the orange or blue dots you will move around the location of the triangle showing $\Delta f$ and $\Delta x$

On the bottom graph, you can compare two lines corresponding to the exact derivative and its approximation.
