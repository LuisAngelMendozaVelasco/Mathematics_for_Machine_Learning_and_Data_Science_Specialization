# Week 4: Determinants and Eigenvectors

In this final week, you will take a deeper look at determinants. You will learn how determinants can be geometrically interpreted as an area and how to calculate determinant of product and inverse of matrices. We conclude this course with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Eigenvectors are used in dimensionality reduction in machine learning. You will see how eigenvectors naturally follow from the concept of eigenbases.

## Learning Objectives

- Interpret the determinant of a matrix as an area and calculate determinant of an inverse of a matrix and a product of matrices.
- Determine the bases and span of vectors.
- Find eigenbases for a special type of linear transformations commonly used in machine learning.
- Calculate the eignenvalues and eigenvectors of a linear transformation (matrix).
